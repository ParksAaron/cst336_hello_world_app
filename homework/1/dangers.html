                    At the rate that artificial intelligence is increasing, the dangers that could be a result of having computers smarter and more capable than humans are becoming more realistic and apparent.
                    The National Institute of Standards and Technology claim to have standards, tests, and metrics to ensure that the artificial intelligence being created is safe and reliable, but experts in the field are still very worried about the future.
                    Although there are many parties that are very excited for new AI development, some are very cautious of what it might bring.
                    Stephen Hawking once said that artificial intelligence could lead to the end of the human race.
                    At the MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics departmentâ€™s Centennial Symposium Elon Musk spoke about how inventors and programmers need to be very cautious of artificial intellgence and how far they push the boundaries because he also views it as our greatest threat.
                    Bill Gates has also said that he agrees with Musk, and saif that if artificial intellgence gets too strong, it should be a major concern.
                    While inventors and programmers are pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence, and consumers are getting excited, Gates and Musk do not understand why people are not more worried about are future if artificial intellgence will be a large part of it.
