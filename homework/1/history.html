                    The first artificially intelligent program was created by Christopher Strachey in 1951, which was able to play a complete game of checkers.
                    Next, the first case of machine learning was created by Anthony Oettinger, and it was a shopping simulator.
                    The computer "shopper" would be sent out to find different items in virtual "stores", and would return the item once it was found.
                    When it found the item, the "shopper" would note it, so that it would visit the store it was found in if the item was requested again.
                    These examples seem very elementary today, but they set the groundwork for what was to come.

                    In 1955, Allen Newell, J. Clifford Shaw, and Herbert Simon created the Logic Theorist, which was able to prove theorems from Principia Mathematica.
                    It was even able to write a more complex proof than included in the books themselves in one case.
                    Soon after the Logic Theorist, the GPS was created in 1957, and it was able to solve many puzzles using trial and error.
                    The biggest flaw with GPS though was that its information that it did not get through puzzle-specific trial and error had to be programmed explicitly.

                <h2 class="left-heading"> Microworld </h2>
                </br>
                <p class="sub-content">
                    Soon after computers were proving theories,"Microworlds", very simple virtual environments modeled after real-world situations, were starting to be created for virtual robots to interact in.
                    An example of a Micorworld is SHRDLU, which Terry Winograd created in 1972 where a virtual robotic arm could interact with blocks and react to several different commands.
                    The arm was able to stack and interact with blocks, but the most impressive feature was that it was able to answer questions regarding what it had done.
                    Bertram Raphael and Nils Nilsson decided to take Microworlds a step further however when they created a real-life robot, and designed a microworld based on a real room, so that the virtual robot's actions in the virtual room controlled the real robot.
                    The robot named Shakey could interact with the room through pushing, climbing, and walking around objects, but it was heavily criticized because it took the robot days to plan out and perform these actions that a human could do in a matter of seconds.
