                    The most common use of artificial intelligence in today's world is built right into your smartphone.
                    Applications like Siri and Alexa decipher speech and perform the actions that the user tells it to do.
                    Although these actions are very simple, like making an appointment or playing a song, it is still artificial intelligence and is very common in today's world.

                    Self-driving cars like Tesla, for example, include artificial intelligence in order to react to things on the road.
                    Because of the complexities of driving, self-driving cars do not just run a simple program telling them to go to point a to point b.
                    The cars' computers have to react to things on the road like other drivers and pedestrians in order to ensure safety for all.

                    Amazon uses artificial intelligence in order to predict what users will want to purchase next.
                    The company's AI looks at what users have purchased recently and what items they have been looking at, and determines what the user may want.
                    Amazon is constantly updating their AI in order to make it more and more accurate, and they are planning a future update, where they order and ship something for you simply based off of what the program thinks you may want.
