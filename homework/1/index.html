                <p> Artificial intelligence refers to a computer being able to perform intelligent or human-like actions.</p>
                
                <p> These actions include learning from experience, making rational decisions, and being able to reason.  </p>
                
                <p> While these machines are currently being focused on only performing specific tasks instead of simply being intelligent beings, artificially intelligent machines are capable of rivaling human experts in their fields.</p>
                
                <p> Although artificial intelligence has proven to be incredibly useful in many different fields, it comes with its own risks as well. </p>
